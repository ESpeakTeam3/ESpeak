/*-
 * EspeakService class is used to call native EspeakNG functions
 * EspeakService loads libespeakservice.so library witch calls EspeakNG public library functions and 
 * use JNI to return values back to this Java class. At this stage libespeakservice.so library
 * is written "by hand". 
 * 
 * If this class is changed there should be according changes made to /jni/src/eSpeakService.c and
 * libespeakservice.so should be recompiled. To ease this task there is bash script updateJNIchanges.sh
 * Before executing this script for the first time there should be path variables updated in it. It is normal 
 * if it shows some warnings for EspeakNG code part (.. espeak-ng/src/libespeak-ng/event.h... warning: ..).  
 * 
 * If some of necessary functions are not exposed in espeak-ng, check *.h file and add in *.c file lines: 
 *     ...
 *     #pragma GCC visibility push(default) // expose following function to public API
 *     exposedFuction() 
 *     ...
 *     #pragma GCC visibility pop 			// stop exposing to public API
 *     ...
 * and rerun updateJNIchanges.sh script.
